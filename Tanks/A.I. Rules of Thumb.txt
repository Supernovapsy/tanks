Rules of thumb

- If there is way forward and no way to the sides, continue forward

- If there is no way forward and way(s) to the sides, pick a side and go there

- If there is no way forward or to the sides, but there is a way to the back, go back

- If there is a way forward and a way to the sides, do a random and continue

- If there is no way anywhere, do a random direction
